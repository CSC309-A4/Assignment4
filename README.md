Food Share Application

How To Use:
- npm install (this should install the required dependencies, like express, mongodb, etc.)
- mongod (start the database - should listen on the default port 27017)
- node server.js (start the server)
- open browser, localhost:3000

- The database name is "foodshare", so if you want to do quick queries in the mongo shell type, mongo foodshare or do "use foodshare"

Notes: 
- The project is not complete yet.
