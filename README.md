Food Share Application

How To Use:
- navigate to the a4p2 directory
- npm install (this should install the required dependencies in package.json)
- mongod (start the database - should listen on the default port 27017)
- node server.js (start the server process)
- open browser, localhost:3000

- The database name is "foodshare", so if you want to see quickly what the database contents are, type mongo foodshare, then run db.collection.find()


To Do:
- Orders - User makes order from their profile page, deliverers can confirm orders on their profile page
- Admin

- Code cleanup. Notice the parallels between user and deliverer sign up / login code in server.js. Some of this is repeated code,
and can be optimized with functions / callback functions
- Testing
- Performance
- Writeups
- Video
